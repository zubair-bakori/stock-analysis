# Stock analysis:
## Overview
-  The purpose of this project is to refactor a code that was previously used to analyse 2017 and 2018 Wall Street data in order to help Steve's parents determine which green stocks to invest in based on their performance in those years. we would also see if it runs faster than the original script.

## Results
- Below are tables showing performance of the 12 green stocks in 2017 and 2018 from the data. In 2017 11 out 12 returned gains of between 5%-200% while in 2018 only 2 out of 12 returned positive gains of over 80%. Both results were printed in about 0.1 sec.

## Summary
- Refactoring the original code with simple lines has automated the stock analysis for any number or group of stocks quite easily and fast.
- In our case we have seen how 12 green energy stocks are analysed with a button click in the blink of an eye.
